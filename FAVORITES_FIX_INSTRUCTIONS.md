# Favorites Section Fix - Instructions

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Database Schema Mismatch** (Critical Issue)
**Problem:** The database migration and schema.js file had conflicting type definitions:
- Migration SQL had `user_id` as INTEGER, but schema.js defined it as TEXT
- Migration SQL had `cook_time` and `servings` as INTEGER, but schema.js defined them as TEXT
- This caused database insertion errors when saving favorites

**Fix:** Created a new migration file to recreate the table with correct types matching schema.js

### 2. **Backend Type Conversion Errors**
**Problem:** Server was trying to parse TEXT fields as integers
**Fix:** Updated all endpoints to properly handle data types:
- `userId` → kept as STRING (Clerk user IDs are strings)
- `cookTime` → kept as STRING (e.g., "30 minutes")
- `servings` → kept as STRING (e.g., "2-4 servings")

### 3. **Frontend Data Type Issues**
**Problem:** Frontend wasn't explicitly converting values to correct types
**Fix:** Updated recipe detail screen to explicitly convert values to strings before sending to backend

### 4. **Favorites Not Auto-Refreshing**
**Problem:** Favorites screen didn't update when returning from recipe detail
**Fix:** Added `useFocusEffect` hook to reload favorites when screen is focused

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `backend/src/server.js` - Fixed type handling in all favorites endpoints
2. `backend/src/db/migrations/0001_fix_favorites_schema.sql` - New migration to fix schema
3. `backend/src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` - Updated to include new migration
4. `backend/src/db/migrations/meta/0001_snapshot.json` - New snapshot for migration
5. `backend/src/migrate.js` - New migration runner script
6. `backend/package.json` - Added migration scripts

### Frontend
1. `mobile/YumVerse/app/recipe/[id].jsx` - Fixed data type conversions when saving favorites
2. `mobile/YumVerse/app/(tabs)/favorites.jsx` - Added auto-refresh and better error handling

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### 1. Run the Database Migration

**Option A: Using the migration script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd backend
npm run db:migrate
```

**Option B: Using Drizzle push**
```bash
cd backend
npm run db:push
```

**Option C: Manual SQL (if above don't work)**
Connect to your database and run:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "favorites";

CREATE TABLE "favorites" (
	"id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	"user_id" text NOT NULL,
	"recipe_id" integer NOT NULL,
	"title" text NOT NULL,
	"image" text,
	"cook_time" text,
	"servings" text,
	"created_at" timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

### 2. Restart the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Favorites Functionality
1. Open the app on your device/emulator
2. Navigate to any recipe detail page
3. Tap the bookmark/favorite button
4. Go to the Favorites tab
5. Verify the recipe appears in your favorites
6. Go back to the recipe and tap bookmark again to remove it
7. Return to Favorites tab and verify it's removed

## Troubleshooting

### If migration fails:
1. Check your DATABASE_URL in backend/.env
2. Ensure you have access to the database
3. Try the manual SQL approach

### If favorites still don't save:
1. Check backend console for error messages
2. Check mobile app console logs
3. Verify the API_URL in `mobile/YumVerse/constants/api.js` is correct
4. Make sure backend server is running

### If favorites don't show up:
1. Check network tab to see if API calls are successful
2. Look for console errors in both frontend and backend
3. Verify user is logged in with Clerk

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Can add a recipe to favorites
- [ ] Can remove a recipe from favorites
- [ ] Favorites appear on the Favorites tab
- [ ] Favorites list updates when navigating back from recipe detail
- [ ] Recipe shows correct bookmark state (filled vs outline)
- [ ] No console errors when adding/removing favorites
- [ ] Backend logs show successful database operations

## Code Quality Improvements Made

### Scalability
- ✅ Proper type handling ensures data consistency
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Async/await patterns properly implemented
- ✅ Database schema matches application code

### Maintainability
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Consistent data types throughout the stack
- ✅ Migration system in place for future schema changes
- ✅ Proper error messages for debugging
- ✅ Added helpful console logs for tracking data flow

### Next Steps / Potential Improvements
1. **Add Loading States:** Show loading spinner when adding/removing favorites
2. **Optimistic Updates:** Update UI immediately before API call completes
3. **Add Pagination:** If user has many favorites, load them in batches
4. **Add Pull-to-Refresh:** Allow user to manually refresh favorites list
5. **Cache Favorites:** Store in local state to reduce API calls
6. **Add Animations:** Smooth transitions when adding/removing favorites
7. **Error Recovery:** Retry failed requests automatically
8. **Offline Support:** Queue favorite changes when offline
9. **Add Indexes:** Add database indexes on userId for faster queries
10. **Add Unique Constraint:** Prevent duplicate favorites (userId + recipeId)

## Summary

The favorites feature was broken due to a critical database schema mismatch. The fix involved:
1. Creating a new migration to align database types with code
2. Updating backend to handle types correctly
3. Ensuring frontend sends properly formatted data
4. Adding auto-refresh functionality for better UX

After applying the migration and restarting the server, the favorites functionality should work perfectly!
